# deep-learning-challenge



This is Attempt #1
   APPLICATION_TYPE cutoff = 600
   CLASSIFICATION cutoff = 300
    layer1 = 9 : activation function = relu
   layer2 = 18 : activation function = relu

   Loss: 0.5536191259042167, Accuracy: 0.7267638444900513
    loss value of 55 indicates that the model can be further optimized.
    The accuracy percent shows that 72% of the model's predicted values align with the true values in the original dataset.

   I need to make some changes in order to get to 75% accuracy. 

   I also ran the following variables through this model:


   APPLICATION_TYPE cutoff = 600
    CLASSIFICATION cutoff = 300
    layer1 = 12
    layer2 = 24

   Loss: 0.5539003014564514, Accuracy: 0.7267638444900513
    
    
    
 This is Attempt #2
    APPLICATION_TYPE cutoff = 600
    CLASSIFICATION cutoff = 300
    layer1 = 9 : activation function = relu
    layer2 = 18 : activation function = tanh
    layer3 = 27 : activation function = tanh

   Loss: 0.5513413424950647, Accuracy: 0.7266472578048706

   A loss value of 55 indicates that the model can be further optimized.
   The accuracy percent shows that 72% of the model's predicted values align with the true values in the original dataset.

   Still not at 75% accuracy. I give up.
